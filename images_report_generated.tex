This bar chart presents the relationship between modules and total travel time for the 1000 nodes Module Change experimental scenario. The x-axis displays modules values ranging from 4 to 7, while the y-axis quantifies total travel time. The single-series visualization facilitates analysis of how the dependent variable responds to changes in the independent parameter setting.

Analysis of the plotted data reveals that total travel time ranges from 6779.83 (at modules = 4) to 6808.90 (at modules = 5), representing a span of 29.07 units. The overall trend is increasing, with values rising from 6779.83 at the initial setting to 6808.90 at the final setting.

This bar chart presents the relationship between swapping time and run time for the 500 nodes Swapping Time experimental scenario. The x-axis displays swapping time values ranging from 1 to 4, while the y-axis quantifies run time. The single-series visualization facilitates analysis of how the dependent variable responds to changes in the independent parameter setting.

These results indicate that threshold configuration meaningfully impacts total distance covered in this experimental context. The substantial variation observed (coefficient of variation exceeding 20\%) suggests that parameter tuning could yield significant performance improvements. Confidence in these findings is high given the direct correspondence between CSV data and plotted values. Future analysis should consider incorporating error bars representing variance across multiple experimental runs to strengthen statistical validity.

This bar chart presents the relationship between threshold and total module swapped for the Sumo Static Threshold experimental scenario. The x-axis displays threshold values ranging from 5 to 20, while the y-axis quantifies total module swapped. The single-series visualization facilitates analysis of how the dependent variable responds to changes in the independent parameter setting.

Analysis of the plotted data reveals that total module swapped ranges from 0.00 (at threshold = 5) to 0.00 (at threshold = 5), representing a span of 0.00 units. The values remain relatively stable across the parameter range, with minimal net change between initial (0.00) and final (0.00) settings. 

These results indicate that threshold configuration meaningfully impacts total module swapped in this experimental context. The relatively modest variation suggests that this parameter has limited influence on the measured metric within the tested range. Confidence in these findings is high given the direct correspondence between CSV data and plotted values. Future analysis should consider incorporating error bars representing variance across multiple experimental runs to strengthen statistical validity.

This bar chart presents the relationship between threshold and total travel time for the Sumo Static Threshold experimental scenario. The x-axis displays threshold values ranging from 5 to 20, while the y-axis quantifies total travel time. The single-series visualization facilitates analysis of how the dependent variable responds to changes in the independent parameter setting.

Analysis of the plotted data reveals that total travel time ranges from 86.54 (at threshold = 10) to 106.44 (at threshold = 5), representing a span of 19.90 units. The overall trend is decreasing, with values declining from 106.44 at the initial setting to 92.73 at the final setting. Notably, the minimum value occurs at an intermediate threshold setting (10), suggesting non-monotonic behavior that warrants further investigation.

These results indicate that threshold configuration meaningfully impacts total travel time in this experimental context. The substantial variation observed (coefficient of variation exceeding 20\%) suggests that parameter tuning could yield significant performance improvements. Confidence in these findings is high given the direct correspondence between CSV data and plotted values. Future analysis should consider incorporating error bars representing variance across multiple experimental runs to strengthen statistical validity.
